# Four Pillars of OOP


## **Encapsulation**
Encapsulation is when all of the relevant information and functionalities(`attributes` and `methods`) are contained within the object itself. There is no need to have variables or functions elsewhere, as we can keept it all `encapsulated` within the object itself.

Encapsulation typically refers to a `private state` within a class.

## **Abstraction**
`Abstraction` is the idea of taking away (`abstract`) all the complex logic(code) away from the user.

In programming, `abstraction` would be the equivalent of rather than expecting the user to perform all of the individual steps requried to get their output, you have a method in your class that does it for them.

## **Inheritance**
The ability of one object to aqcuire some (or all) properties and methods from another object. 

With OOP, our main focus is resuability.

## **Polymorphism**

Polymorphism build on inheritance, in that it allows each `child` class to have the same `attributes` and `methods` as the parent class, but with its own unique attributes and methods as well.
